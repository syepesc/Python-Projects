2) The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay
period in a text file called data.txt. The format of each line of the file is the following:

Create 10 lines of data.

Write a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints to the
terminal a report of the wages paid to the employees for the given
period. The report should be in tabular format with the appropriate
header. Each line should contain an employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked,
and the wages paid for that period.
